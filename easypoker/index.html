		    <p class = "description">This site has been engineered specifically for use at home games of poker.
			    You will enter what type of poker you are playing, how many different chips you have, how many people
			    are playing, and what type of game pace. You will then be informed on how many chips to give out, and the game is on.
			    During the game, the screen will include a timer and which chips are in play. Enjoy!</p>
